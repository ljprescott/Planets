    "## Part I: Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \tWhat is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and how does that differ from the Command Line Interface (CLI)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tA GUI (pronounced gooey) is a program with drop down menus that guides the user with choices. The CLI, on the other hand, is a program that accepts commands from a use in the form of text. The CLI does not have drop down options like a GUI. A GUI is a bit more restrictive than the CLI but typically is more user friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tWhat does the shell do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe shell is a program that runs other programs\n",
    "\tThere is technically a difference between the CLI and the shell but they are essentially the same in that the shell is a program \n",
    "\t(there are many different versions of a shell) that allow a user to interact with a computer via text command lines with varying complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tWhat is the command used for listing things in a directory?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tls\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tWhat is the command used for changing directories?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tcd\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tWhat command would you use to get your current working directory?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tpwd\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\tHow do you get the manual for these commands?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tman\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tWhat does the shell prompt look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tmy shell prompt is % but it can also be $\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\tHow would you list things in a directory in chronological order?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tls -t\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\tName two ways to get to the ‘home’ or ‘root’ directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t/ would take you to root and ~ would take you home\n",
    "\n",
    "10.\tWhat is the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tan absolute path does not change wherever you are, it will always contain root / and the full directory path, you can always enter that path and it will take you directly there. \n",
    "\tA relative path, on the other hand, does change depedning on where you are\n",
    "\tit is 'relative' to your position. For example, /Users/leah/Desktop is an absolute path but getting there from a nested folder using .. is relative.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.\tWhat are the two relative path directories we talked about and what do they mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tWe used .. and ~/data/.. to move from a folder called Data to the home directory\n",
    "\n",
    "12.\tWhy shouldn’t you put spaces in filenames?\n",
    "\n",
    "\twhen using the command line, a white space is treated as a separator for commands, e.g. ls -S has a space between the command ls and argument -S. \n",
    "\n",
    "13.\tName a way to have multiple readable words in a filename without spaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tfile_name_with_words.txt\n",
    "\tFileNameWithWords.txt\n",
    "\tfile-name-with-words.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "14.\tWhat is the program nano, what does it do? Do you use nano? If not what do you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tnano is a text editor used within the terminal. I do not use nano, I use VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.\t``*`` is a form of a wildcard. What does it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tthe wildcard * means that anything *before or after* the * can be ANY text, number, etc so you could have 1before, 2before, redbefore or after3, after4, aftergreen etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "16.\tThe following code would match what? \n",
    "\t\t```ls *.txt``` \n",
    "\n",
    "\tthis would list any .txt file in the current directory\n",
    "\n",
    "17.\tWhy do we need to be careful with the ```mv``` command?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tthis is the move command and would move files. We have to be careful because it can overwrite files with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "18.\tWhy do we need to be careful with the ```rm``` command?\n",
    "\n",
    "\trm removes files and is very dangerous because the file is completely deleted from your computer, not just sent to trash. \n",
    "\tYou can set up a 2 factor checkpoint that asks \"are you sure you want to remove? y/n\" to be safer\n",
    "\n",
    "19.\tWhat is the difference between ```>``` and ```>>```?\n",
    "\n",
    "\t> and >> are both ways of directing an output into a file (either by creating a new file or modifying an existing file)\n",
    "\ta single > will overwrite the existing file (if it exists) and a double >> will append the output to the end of the file (if it exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "20.\tWhat does ```head``` do? \n",
    "\n",
    "\thead will display the first n lines of a file (default n = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "21.\tWhat is the purpose of ```|``` (pipe)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tA pipe will combine commands such that you can send an output through multiple commands at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "22.\tInterpret the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t```cat huge_file.fasta | uniq | head -n 5 >proteins.fasta```\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThis would identify all unique lines of huge_file, select the first 5 and concatenate them together to proteins.fasta if the file does not exist, if there is a proteins file it will overwrite\n",
    "\n",
    "23.\tWhat is a loop and when would you use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tA loop iterates over n things, running the same commands on each iteration. You would use a loop if you want to do the same thing to many lines of data or many files (e.g. extracting data from many files and moving it into a new file, or adding data onto each sample within your data, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "24.\tIn a directory with the following files. What would the following loop do?\n",
    "         \n",
    "\t ```apple.txt, banana.txt, orange.txt \n",
    "\t\t$ for  filename in  *.txt; do\n",
    "\t\t> cat  ${filename}  >>fruits.txt\n",
    "\t\t> done\n",
    "\t\n",
    "25.\tWhat is a shell script?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tShell scripts are ways to save shell commands so we can quickly rerun them typically .sh files\n",
    "\n",
    "26.\tWhat are the benefits of writing and running a script over typing the code in?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIt will be saved for future use, so you don't have to retype the commands again and again\n",
    "\n",
    "27.\tWhen looking at a script what does ```#``` mean? Why would you use one?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tA hash will denote a nonexecutable statement, it's typically used to 'hash' out text as a comment so the computer doesn't try to run the text as code but can also be used to break up code visually or can be used in markdown to change header sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "28.\tWhat does ```grep``` stand for and what does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tgrep (pronounced \"grr ehp\", not \"jee rep\" like I first assumed) stands for the commands g, re, and p all together: global search, regular expression, print\n",
    "\tBasically, it searches through a file for a string of text (e.g. 'ATGA') and returns any matches per the regular expression\n",
    "\n",
    "29.\tWhat does ```find``` do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tfind will search through specified directories (typically all but can be limited) for  a file based on a regular expression e.g. 'file.txt' vs 'file*\""
